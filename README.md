# ut-hdfs-file-monitor-linux
This Universal Task provides a file monitor and optionally trigger, which monitors a file on the Hadoop HDFS file system. If the file is found the file monitor goes to success or can optionally launch automatically a Universal Controller Task. It also possible to run the Task monitor in auto restart mode, which means it re-starts itself automatically after it found a file.
